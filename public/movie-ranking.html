<h3>Ice Age</h3>
<p>Used to watch it on repated when I was a child.</p>
<h3>Stick it</h3>
<p>Sport movie, makes little bit of fun of athletes, has an emotional story, happy end</p>
<h3>Father of the Bride</h3>
<p>My fondest memory is of our family sitting and laughing at the movie. We would watch it every time it was on. Amazing cast, funny. </p>
